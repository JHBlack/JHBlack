Hello, my name is John. I love to build software. I'm just getting my start in software development and I will be building a few projects soon. 

I am now enrolling at the University of the People, pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. This page will be a demonstration of my journey. 

Feel free to check me out on my other profiles. Links to my social media to come soon.
